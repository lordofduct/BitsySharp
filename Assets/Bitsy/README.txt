## README - First Draft
##################

Attach the 'BitsyComponent' script to a GameObject that also has some renderer that uses a material with a 'mainTexture' (something like the 'Quad').

Drag a text file onto the 'GameData' field in the inspector. The text file should contain the contents of the 'Game Data' window of the 'Bitsy Game Maker' tool.

Done.
